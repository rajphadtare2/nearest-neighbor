KDTree Color Search

A Java project that builds a KD-Tree of colors in the CIE LAB color space to efficiently find the nearest color match for a given input. Uses Nearest Neighbor Algorithm.

Features:

Converts RGB/hex colors to CIE LAB for perceptual distance calculations.

KD-Tree data structure for fast nearest-neighbor search in 3D LAB space.

Serialization of the KD-Tree for quick reuse without rebuilding.

Reads input colors from a CSV file in src/main/resources
